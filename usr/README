USER PROGRAM

    The program basically talks to the daemon and gets info
on each player as the move or change direction.  Each player
decides if he dies, and, if so, transmits this info to the
player who killed him.

    When compiling on a non-sun, use:

	make vax

Otherwise, compile with
	
	make sun

   Good luck!
